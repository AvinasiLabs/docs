# Foundation Models

DeLong Foundation Models is the premier hub for state-of-the-art artificial intelligence in biology. We bridge the gap between advanced machine learning and life science research by providing a unified, secure, and scalable platform for accessing the world’s most powerful bio-foundation models.

In an era where biological data is exploding in complexity, researchers face two critical challenges: the fragmentation of model tools and the privacy risks of sharing sensitive data. The DeLong Foundation Models module solves both by aggregating top-tier open-source and proprietary models into a single ecosystem, all powered by our confidential computing infrastructure.

#### Key Capabilities

**1. A Curated, Multi-Modal Library**

We don't just host models; we curate the industry standard. Our repository encompasses the full spectrum of biological scales:

* Proteomics: Structure prediction and protein folding (e.g., AlphaFold-style architectures, ESM).
* Genomics: Large language models (LLMs) specialized in DNA and RNA sequence analysis.
* Cheminformatics: Molecular property prediction, toxicity screening, and drug discovery optimization.
* DeLong Proprietary: Exclusive, high-performance models developed by Avinasi Labs for specialized bio-niches.

**2. Privacy-First Inference (TEE)**

Security is not an afterthought—it is our architecture. Every inference request runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

* Data Sovereignty: Your proprietary sequences and datasets utilize our compute power but remain encrypted in use. Even platform administrators cannot view your raw inputs or model outputs.
* Regulatory Ready: Designed to meet the stringent data protection standards required by pharmaceutical R\&D and clinical research.

**3. Unified Developer Experience**

Gone are the days of managing conflicting dependencies and complex environment setups for different models.

* Standardized API: Access diverse models through a single, RESTful API compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* Python SDK: Integrate powerful AI capabilities into your existing pipelines with just a few lines of code using `delong-models`.
* Interactive Playground: Test hypotheses instantly via our zero-code web interface.
