# Algorithms' API (Coming soon...)

The **DeLong Models API** provides programmatic access to a curated library of bio-science foundation models. It is designed to be easily integrated into existing bioinformatics pipelines and supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless discovery.

All inference tasks run on our TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) infrastructure, ensuring data confidentiality.
