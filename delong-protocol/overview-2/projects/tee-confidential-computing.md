# TEE Confidential Computing

TEE confidential computing is the core security feature of DeLong.

* Default Encryption: Your project runs inside a hardware-encrypted enclave. Cloud providers and DeLong administrators cannot see the data in your RAM.
* Attestation (Upcoming): You can verify the integrity of your environment with the trusted third parties (Intel or AMD). Click the Shield Icon 🛡️ in the top toolbar to view the cryptographic attestation report, confirming that the code running is exactly what you deployed and has not been tampered with.
