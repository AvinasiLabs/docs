# Projects

The Research Projects Management module is the command center of the DeLong ecosystem. It is a unified workspace designed to manage the entire lifecycle of a life science discovery—from the initial hypothesis and data collection to model training and final publication.

Unlike traditional cloud IDEs, every Research Project on DeLong is built on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) foundation. This means your proprietary algorithms, sensitive patient data, and intellectual property (IP) remain encrypted in memory during processing, protecting your work from unauthorized access.
