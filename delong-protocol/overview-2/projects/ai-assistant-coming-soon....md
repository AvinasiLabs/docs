# AI Assistant (Coming soon...)

#### Research Chat Assistant

Located in the right-hand sidebar, this assistant is your interactive research partner, capable of complex reasoning and biological context understanding.

* Core Capabilities:
  * Literature Review: Ask complex questions like _"Summarize the latest mechanisms of action for GLP-1 agonists"_ or _"Find papers related to this gene expression pattern."_
  * Hypothesis Generation: Discuss experimental designs. Example: _"Suggest a control group for this CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiment."_
  * Data Interpretation: Paste snippets of your results or logs into the chat to get an explanation of biological significance or potential anomalies.
* Context Awareness: The chat assistant can "see" your current project files (if you grant permission), allowing it to answer questions specific to your uploaded datasets.

#### In-line Code Copilot

Integrated directly into the Jupyter Notebook and Terminal cells, this assistant focuses on writing, fixing, and optimizing your code in real-time.

* Core Capabilities:
  * Ghost Text / Autocomplete: As you type, gray "ghost text" will appear suggesting the next line of code. Press `Tab` to accept.&#x20;
  * Smart Generation: Type a comment description (e.g., `# Plot the PCA of the gene expression matrix`) and press `Enter`. The Copilot will generate the code block for you.
  * Refactoring: Highlight a block of code to ask the Copilot to _"Optimize this loop"_ or _"Add error handling."_
