# Lab

This section covers DeLong Lab, the first application built on the protocol. You'll learn about the TEE-secured Jupyter environments that enable privacy-preserving dataset access without exposing raw data, the Python SDK for integrating protocol datasets into research workflows, and the longevity foundation models designed specifically for aging biology and therapeutic discovery research.
