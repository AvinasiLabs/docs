# DeLong Lab

DeLong Lab serves as the first application built on the protocol, offering researchers TEE-secured Jupyter environments, Python SDK, and longevity foundation models for dataset consumption.

## TEE-Secured Jupyter Environments

Confidential computing environments where researchers can access tokenized datasets without exposing raw data. The TEE verifies access permissions on-chain before granting dataset decryption keys.

## Python SDK

Developer tools for integrating DeLong Protocol datasets into research workflows, including authentication, access verification, and dataset loading utilities.

## Longevity Foundation Models

Pre-trained models and analysis tools specifically designed for longevity research, enabling researchers to leverage tokenized datasets for aging biology, healthspan analysis, and therapeutic discovery.
