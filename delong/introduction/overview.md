# Delong Protocol

DeLong is a decentralized longevity data securitization protocol, enabling datasets to be tokenized as income-generating securities backed by rental revenue.

## What DeLong Does

DeLong transforms longevity research datasets into tradeable asset-backed securities:

- Research teams tokenize their datasets and raise capital through Initial Data Offerings
- Researchers pay to access the data
- Token holders receive proportional dividends from rental revenue and maintain governance control over project operations

The protocol removes trust requirements through code-enforced protections. Treasury funds cannot be withdrawn without token holder approval. Trading liquidity is permanently guaranteed through locked Uniswap pools. Failed projects enable proportional capital recovery through formal delisting procedures.

## Core Components

**Initial Data Offering** – Projects raise capital through continuous price discovery where earlier participants receive proportionally better terms. When the funding goal is reached, raised funds are split between creating a permanent Uniswap liquidity pool and depositing treasury reserves under governance control.

**Governance** – Token holders vote on treasury allocations, operational parameters, and project continuation. All fund withdrawals require proposal approval through on-chain voting. No privileged roles or admin keys exist that could bypass governance.

**Rental Revenue** – Researchers pay rental fees to access datasets in privacy-preserving computation environments. The majority of rental payments are distributed to token holders as dividends, with a small portion allocated to protocol operations.

**Permanent Liquidity** – Uniswap LP tokens are sent directly to the governance contract during launch with no removal mechanism. This guarantees secondary market trading throughout the project lifecycle.

**Capital Recovery** – Token holders can vote to shut down underperforming or abandoned projects. The protocol returns remaining treasury funds plus recovered liquidity pool assets proportionally to token holders.
