# Delong Protocol

_Author: Dylan, Avinasi Labs_

DeLong is a decentralized data asset issuance protocol for longevity research, enabling datasets to be tokenized with built-in revenue sharing and investor protections.

## What DeLong Does

DeLong enables data providers to tokenize their longevity datasets and raise capital through Initial Data Offerings (IDO):

- Anyone or organizations can tokenize their datasets and raise capital through IDO
- Researchers pay rental fees to access data in privacy-preserving computation environments
- Token holders receive proportional dividends from rental revenue and maintain governance control over project operations

**What investors are actually purchasing:** The right to receive a share of rental revenue generated through DeLong Protocol – not ownership or exclusive rights to the underlying data itself. This is similar to how Spotify royalties only come from Spotify plays, even though artists can distribute on other platforms.

Unlike traditional token platforms (ICO, IEO, Launchpad) that support diverse project types, DeLong focuses exclusively on data asset issuance. This uniformity—every project rents out dataset access—enables protocol-level constraints enforced by code:

- **Revenue** – 95% of rental income automatically distributed to token holders
- **Treasury** – All raised capital held in DAO-controlled custody, withdrawals require voting
- **Liquidity** – LP tokens permanently locked, tradability guaranteed
- **Exit** – Token holders can vote to delist failed projects and recover funds
