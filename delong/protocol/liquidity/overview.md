This section explains how DeLong implements permanent liquidity locking while enabling capital recovery. You'll learn how the locking mechanism prevents rug pulls by minting LP tokens directly to governance, how Uniswap's 0.3% trading fees accumulate and increase LP value over time, how impermanent loss affects locked positions differently than standard LPs, and how anyone can verify custody and LP composition on-chain.
