# Governance

The governance system gives token holders direct control over treasury funds, operational parameters, and project lifecycle through on-chain voting enforced by smart contract code rather than trust, with proposals requiring 50% quorum during seven-day voting periods and no admin keys or bypass mechanisms enabling treasury access without majority approval.
