# Governance

This section covers the governance system that gives token holders control over project operations. You'll learn how the treasury architecture enforces custody through smart contracts rather than trust, how the four proposal types enable different governance actions, how voting mechanics use snapshot-based voting power with 50% quorum requirements, and how the delisting process enables capital recovery for failed projects.
