# IDO Overview

The Initial Data Offering mechanism enables fair capital formation for dataset projects through continuous price discovery that rewards early participation.

## How IDO Works

Project teams specify a funding goal and team allocation percentage. The protocol calculates total token supply and initializes fundraising with a low starting price. As investors participate, token price rises continuously based on demand. Earlier investors receive more tokens per dollar than later ones, creating proportional rewards for early commitment.

When the funding goal is reached, the protocol automatically executes launch. Raised capital is divided between creating a permanent Uniswap liquidity pool and depositing treasury funds under governance control. Token transfers are enabled, and the project enters operational phase.

## Key Aspects

**Funding Parameters** – Teams set funding goals and allocation percentages within protocol-defined constraints. These parameters determine token supply and capital distribution between liquidity and treasury.

**Continuous Pricing** – Token price increases smoothly with each purchase. No fixed tiers or arbitrary pricing decisions—the market determines pricing through actual demand.

**Automatic Launch** – When funding completes, the protocol creates Uniswap liquidity, deposits treasury, and enables trading in a single atomic transaction. No manual intervention or coordination required.

**Fair Distribution** – Earlier participants automatically receive better pricing. The relationship between purchase timing and token allocation is deterministic and verifiable.
