# Roadmap

DeLong Ecosystem development roadmap spanning from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026.

## Q4 2025 — FOUNDATION I

**Current Phase**

| Protocol | Infrastructure | AI | Application |
|----------|----------------|----|--------------|
| Ship first version of protocol implementation to testnet | Finish production-level TEE cloud computing platform with full functions | Complete delong-datasets Python SDK v0 based on HuggingFace datasets library | Deploy basic web dApp for testnet |
| Complete at least one full data flow: upload → listing → trade → settlement | Complete ≥1 PoC with real or high-fidelity mock datasets validating TEE custody + on-chain settlement | Begin development of delong-models Python SDK for training/inference | |
| | | Onboard internal and SOTA open source bio science foundation models | |

## Q1 2026 — FOUNDATION II

| Protocol | Infrastructure | AI | Application |
|----------|----------------|----|--------------|
| Introduce unified asset abstraction for data, models, and projects/IP | Optimize dataset storage and encryption | Release delong-models Python SDK v0 | Update web dApp for combined positions in single portfolio view |
| Achieve at least one end-to-end "data + model" scenario on testnet with real revenue distribution | Build customized TEE cloud computing platform with GitHub-like code management | Aggregate bio science foundation models and build comprehensive services | |
| Validate unified asset abstraction with ≥2 distinct use cases | | Begin developing AI-powered foundation models query and chat | |
| | | Explore IP tokenization technical process | |

## Q2 2026 — MAINNET

**Launch Phase**

| Protocol | Infrastructure | AI | Application |
|----------|----------------|----|--------------|
| Launch protocol on mainnet | Support non-2D structures and complex dataset governance | Release delong-models Python SDK v1.0 with open source maintenance | Deploy production-ready web dApp |
| Complete ≥3 mainnet IDOs with independent data providers | | Aggregate 300+ bio-science foundation models with SDK integration | |
| Record first batch of real protocol revenue on mainnet | | Launch AI-powered bio study assistant with high reasoning ability | |
| Maintain mainnet flow (IDO → trading → payouts) for ≥4 consecutive weeks without critical errors | | Release IP tokenization v0.0 standardized technical process | |
| | | Build scientist collaboration network and proprietary model moat | |

## Q3 2026 — Make It Better

| Protocol | Infrastructure | AI | Application |
|----------|----------------|----|--------------|
| Expand DeLong to multi-chain usage | Demonstrate at least one encrypted training/inference workload with on-chain accounting | Develop delong-datasets SDK enhancements | Update contracts and dApp for consistent multi-chain portfolio view |
| Deploy protocol to at least one additional L2/chain | | Develop delong-models SDK enhancements | |
| Validate cross-chain accounting model across at least two chains | | Build life sciences algorithm acceleration SDK | |
| | | Produce research output and full lifecycle validation | |

## Q4 2026 — Make It Powerful

| Protocol | Infrastructure | AI | Application |
|----------|----------------|----|--------------|
| Upgrade protocol for robustness and trust-minimization | Run real deployments with cross-chain positions written into blob-style logs | Achieve AI layer and blockchain full integration | Full integration of all ecosystem components |
| Introduce TEE-based light-client verification for critical economic decisions | Execute sensitive economic logic in TEE with light-client verification | Launch DeLong Laboratory Platform for full lifecycle management of life science research projects | |
| Use blob-style data availability (EIP-4844-like logs) for hardened accounting | | Maintain, upgrade SDK and grow community | |
| | | Deep involvement in life science foundational research | |
