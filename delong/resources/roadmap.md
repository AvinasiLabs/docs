# Roadmap

DeLong Ecosystem development roadmap spanning from Q4 2025 to Q4 2026.

## Q4 2025 — FOUNDATION I

**Current Phase**

**Protocol**
- Ship first version of protocol implementation to testnet
- Complete at least one full data flow: upload → listing → trade → settlement

**Infrastructure**
- Finish production-level TEE cloud computing platform with full functions
- Complete ≥1 PoC with real or high-fidelity mock datasets validating TEE custody + on-chain settlement

**AI**
- Complete delong-datasets Python SDK v0 based on HuggingFace datasets library
- Begin development of delong-models Python SDK for training/inference
- Onboard internal and SOTA open source bio science foundation models

**Application**
- Deploy basic web dApp for testnet

## Q1 2026 — FOUNDATION II

**Protocol**
- Introduce unified asset abstraction for data, models, and projects/IP
- Achieve at least one end-to-end "data + model" scenario on testnet with real revenue distribution
- Validate unified asset abstraction with ≥2 distinct use cases

**Infrastructure**
- Optimize dataset storage and encryption
- Build customized TEE cloud computing platform with GitHub-like code management

**AI**
- Release delong-models Python SDK v0
- Aggregate bio science foundation models and build comprehensive services
- Begin developing AI-powered foundation models query and chat
- Explore IP tokenization technical process

**Application**
- Update web dApp for combined positions in single portfolio view

## Q2 2026 — MAINNET

**Launch Phase**

**Protocol**
- Launch protocol on mainnet
- Complete ≥3 mainnet IDOs with independent data providers
- Record first batch of real protocol revenue on mainnet
- Maintain mainnet flow (IDO → trading → payouts) for ≥4 consecutive weeks without critical errors

**Infrastructure**
- Support non-2D structures and complex dataset governance

**AI**
- Release delong-models Python SDK v1.0 with open source maintenance
- Aggregate 300+ bio-science foundation models with SDK integration
- Launch AI-powered bio study assistant with high reasoning ability
- Release IP tokenization v0.0 standardized technical process
- Build scientist collaboration network and proprietary model moat

**Application**
- Deploy production-ready web dApp

---

## Q3 2026 — Make It Better

**Protocol**
- Expand DeLong to multi-chain usage
- Deploy protocol to at least one additional L2/chain
- Validate cross-chain accounting model across at least two chains

**Infrastructure**
- Demonstrate at least one encrypted training/inference workload with on-chain accounting

**AI**
- Develop delong-datasets SDK enhancements
- Develop delong-models SDK enhancements
- Build life sciences algorithm acceleration SDK
- Produce research output and full lifecycle validation

**Application**
- Update contracts and dApp for consistent multi-chain portfolio view

---

## Q4 2026 — Make It Powerful

**Protocol**
- Upgrade protocol for robustness and trust-minimization
- Introduce TEE-based light-client verification for critical economic decisions
- Use blob-style data availability (EIP-4844-like logs) for hardened accounting

**Infrastructure**
- Run real deployments with cross-chain positions written into blob-style logs
- Execute sensitive economic logic in TEE with light-client verification

**AI**
- Achieve AI layer and blockchain full integration
- Launch DeLong Laboratory Platform for full lifecycle management of life science research projects
- Maintain, upgrade SDK and grow community
- Deep involvement in life science foundational research

**Application**
- Full integration of all ecosystem components
